    <description>To remind us that hope gives us wings when we truly believe.

The fletching of the feather has irregular separations giving the design a natural windswept look. A center vein of brilliant silver finished microbeads juxtaposes the richness of the rose gold fletching, while the hand painted deep black background emphasizes each curve and tendril of design. A thicker edge of bright silver finish completes the design. Necklace pendant has a double jump chain as the bail hanging on a princess length, 19 inch wheat chain.</description>
