     As feather legged horses strain                    against each single tree,                    Life’s heavy burdens shared by                    two are drawn more easily.                    And though you’re now together,                    yoked in love and grace,                    Push not against each other,                    respect the others trace.                    Love shared is not divided,                    but multiplied you see,                    It’s the only time I know, when one                    and one adds up to three...                    Or four, or five, or six, or even seven,                    But be assured each red round face is                    an angel straight from heaven.                    It’s time to take the parents love,                    store it safely, deep within.                     A new page in your book of life                    you must today begin.
