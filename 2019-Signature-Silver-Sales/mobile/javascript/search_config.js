Silver Sales             How do I care for my Montana Silversmiths products?       Montana Silversmiths buckles and jewelry are coated with our trademark protective finish called Montana Armor , which                                                                                                                ®       keeps tarnishing at bay. You only need to wipe down your piece with a dry, 100% cotton cloth to remove any impurities that       may have gathered when wearing. You may also use mild soap and water as needed and pat dry with a soft cloth.       A few tips to ensure the Montana Armor  finish remains intact; please keep your piece away from jewelry cleaners, silver                                             ®       cleaners, treated polishing cloths, perfumes, hairspray, lotions, hand-sanitizers, and make-up. Also, do not soak your item in       water or fail to rinse away soap used to clean. Any of these items can damage the protective coating and cause tarnishing       to occur. Your Montana piece should be the finishing touch as you get ready in the morning. It is also best to tuck your       cherished item away when not wearing.        What materials are used to make Montana Silversmiths buckles and jewelry?       Montana Silversmiths jewelry is created through a multi-step process that begins with a designer’s hand sketch and engraving.       Sterling Lane by Montana Silversmiths is a collection of solid sterling silver products finished with 99.9% fine silver or rhodium,       enhancing the brightness of the metal and preventing tarnish.       Montana Silversmiths brand name jewelry, with the exception of German Silver and Miner’s Finish products, are minted in       solid brass and plated in 99.9% fine silver, 24 karat gold, and/or black gunmetal. German Silver pieces are minted in solid       German Silver and accented with brightly polished jeweler’s bronze.  Miner’s Finish pieces are minted in Jeweler’s Bronze and       finished with a hand-applied patina.        As silver has a natural tendency to tarnish (oxidize) and scratch, we add Montana Armor  to assist in preventing this natural                                                                                        ®       process.       Earring posts, French wires, and lever backs are composed of hypo-allergenic stainless steel or sterling silver.        Rings are manufactured with a solid sterling silver base then plated in brilliant rhodium or finished in fine silver for an even       brighter look with easy care.        The Attitude Collection is a white metal alloy base with various plated finishes including silver oxide, copper and brass.       If my jewelry piece looks tarnished or is turning dark, what do I do?       Just remember this easy tip for keeping your Montana Silver clean. All you need is a dry, 100% cotton cloth and a little elbow       grease. Wiping your item down with the cloth should remove any impurities or darkening that can occur from wearing the       item.       If that does not work, try some mild soap and a little water then pat dry with a soft cloth.       Also, this is important: Soaking your product in water, failing to remove all the soap or treating your jewelry with silver cleaners       or polishing cloths, can remove the protective Montana Armor finish and cause the item to tarnish.
